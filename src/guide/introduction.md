# Introduction

- Through This project, we intend to harvest energy from speed breaker by making gear arrangement and using electronics gadgets. Large amount of electricity can be generated saving lot of money

- When vehicle is in motion it produces various forms of energy like, due to friction  between vehicle’s wheel and road i.e. rough surface HEAT Energy is produced, also when vehicle traveling at high speed strikes the wind. then also energy is produced which is always lost in environment and of which we can’t make use

This energy that we can’t make use of is just the WASTAGE OF ENERGY that is abundantly available around us. In this project we are just trying to make use of such energy in order to generate an ELECTRICAL ENERGY. This project will work on the principle of “POTENTIAL ENERGY TO ELECTRICAL ENERGY CONVERSION” Potential energy can be thought of as energy stored within a physical system. This energy can be released or converted into other forms of energy, including kinetic energy. It is called potential energy because it has the potential <span style="color: #A52A2A">to change the states of objects in the system when the energy is released If h is the height above an arbitrarily assigned reference point, then Kinetic energy of an object is the extra energy which it possesses due to its motion. It is defined as the work needed to accelerate a body of a given mass from rest to its current velocity.</span>
